# Tip-calculator
Solution to the frontend mentor's tip calculator challenge
this solution took me four days to build from start, two days to work on the HTML and CSS.
The JavaScript solution took me another 2 days.
I did a lot of googling to learn new stuffs and it was fun and challenging at the same time.

#Challenges
I got stuck at some point when my CSS wouldn't do what I wanted. it stopped responding all at once.
I also couldn't get my JavaScript right, I wrote functions that could not run and didn't know how to make a function I wrote to fire up when the enter key of the keyboard is pressed.
I also had the issue of not knowing how to check if an input value is all alphabet until I met regex.

#Solution
the problem of my CSS was solved by shutting down my work and giving myself some time to rest and calm.
the JavaScript problem of making the function run upon press of the enter button was googled and solution was gotten, so also was the issue of checking the input value if it is an alphabe, i googled an found regex and behold the solution.
